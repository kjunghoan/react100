## Run Down

This is a personal project that I am doing to make 100 front end components that I will be using to practice UI/UX for the front end following dailyui.co's prompts

My primary tools will be:
  React
  React Native
  typescript
which I will use for every component and will look to make a full application at the end with most if not all of the components
